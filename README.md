Spring Boot provides a wide range of annotations to simplify the development of Java applications. Here are the top 10 most commonly used Spring Boot annotations:

1. `@SpringBootApplication`: This annotation is used to mark the main class of a Spring Boot application. It combines three annotations: `@Configuration`, `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, and `@ComponentScan`.

2. `@RestController`: This annotation is used to define a RESTful controller class. It combines the `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody` annotations.

3. `@RequestMapping`: This annotation is used to map a URL path or pattern to a controller method. It can be applied at the class or method level.

4. `@Autowired`: This annotation is used for automatic dependency injection. It allows Spring to resolve and inject dependencies into a class.

5. `@Service`: This annotation is used to mark a class as a service component. It is typically used in the service layer of an application.

6. `@Repository`: This annotation is used to mark a class as a repository component. It is typically used in the data access layer for database operations.

7. `@Component`: This annotation is a generic annotation used to mark a class as a Spring component. It can be used as a stereotype for any Spring-managed bean.

8. `@Value`: This annotation is used to inject values from properties files or environment variables into fields or method parameters.

9. `@Configuration`: This annotation is used to define a class as a configuration class. It is often used in conjunction with `@Bean` methods to define beans.

10. `@EnableAutoConfiguration`: This annotation is used to enable Spring Boot's auto-configuration feature. It automatically configures beans and dependencies based on the classpath and the defined dependencies.

Here are 10 additional annotations that are commonly used in Spring Boot applications:

11. `@GetMapping`: This annotation is a shortcut for `@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET)`. It is used to handle HTTP GET requests.

12. `@PostMapping`: This annotation is a shortcut for `@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.POST)`. It is used to handle HTTP POST requests.

13. `@PutMapping`: This annotation is a shortcut for `@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.PUT)`. It is used to handle HTTP PUT requests.

14. `@DeleteMapping`: This annotation is a shortcut for `@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.DELETE)`. It is used to handle HTTP DELETE requests.

15. `@PathVariable`: This annotation is used to bind a method parameter to a path variable in the request URL.

16. `@RequestParam`: This annotation is used to bind a method parameter to a query parameter in the request URL.

17. `@RequestBody`: This annotation is used to bind the request body to a method parameter in a controller method.

18. `@Valid`: This annotation is used to enable validation on a method parameter or return value using bean validation annotations.

19. `@Transactional`: This annotation is used to define a transactional method or class. It ensures that the method's operations are executed within a transaction.

20. `@ExceptionHandler`: This annotation is used to handle exceptions thrown by controller methods.

These are just a selection of commonly used Spring Boot annotations. There are many more annotations available in the Spring Boot ecosystem that cater to various use cases and scenarios.
